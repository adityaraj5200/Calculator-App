## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project, I learned implementing two different themes(light and dark) in a single webpage.
Also brushed up my JavaScript a bit more with this project.


```js
/* Learned how to implement two different theems through this JS code */
let style1_path = "style1.css"
let style2_path = "style2.css"

let link = document.createElement('link');
link.rel = "stylesheet";
link.href = style1_path;

let head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
head.appendChild(link);

let curr_theme;

function apply_style1(){
    curr_theme = 1;
    link.href = style1_path;
}

function apply_style2(){
    curr_theme = 2;
    link.href = style2_path;
}

apply_style1();
```
